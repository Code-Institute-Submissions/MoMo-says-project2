# MoMo Says
Welcome to the MoMo README file.

This is a school project with the main focus to display my skills in HTML, css and javascript. This website's goal is for users and owners to play an animal themed simon says game with three interactive webpage themes.


## UX/UI

### User Stories (UX)
-   As a usertype, I want to play a fun game, to pass my time.

-	As a usertype, the instructions to be simple and easy to understand, so I can play the game easily.

-	As a usertype, to see my current score and my highest score, I that I can compare my own scores.

-	As a usertype, I want to have a restart button, so that I can restart if I want to.

-	As a usertype, I want to have a mute button, so that I can mute audio if I want to.

-	As a usertype, I want there to be a clear structure of the game, so that it does not confuse me.

### Owner Stories (UX)

-   As an ownertype, I want to create a simple yet exiting and responsive game, so that user will want to play more than once.

-   As a ownertype, I want the instructions to be simple and easy for the user to understand, so that they can play easily.

-	As an ownertype, I want to have creative, consistent and interactive features, to appeal to the user which in turn will use the website more.

### Wireframes (UI)

Wireframes for this project was made with [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/).
Before I started programming the webpage the version 1 wireframe was the general interface design aim.
But a few hours into the development process I decided to make minor changes in the interface design
to make the webpage more responsive and user friendly and thus created the version 2 wireframe.
The buttons for lowering and raising the volume was switched to just a mute audio and enable audio button
for the 2 wireframe version.

## Features

### Existing Features
Feature 1 - index.html > (Homepage): allows users to access the full webpage including
the "How to play", MoMo game, highscore and theme buttons.


Feature 2 - index.html > Logo header: interactive MoMo logo that is consistent
throughout the webpage, despite viewport width and theme changes.


Feature 3 - index.html > "How to play": allows users to read clear instructions for
how to play the game and how to win it.


Feature 4 - index.html > MoMo game > start game button: panel with the text "START"
and a font awesome icon of a play button. Allows the user to start the game by pressing
the play button. After pressing the button it disappears and reveals the animal panels.


Feature 5 - index.html > MoMo game: allows the user to play a interactive memory
game with animsl images and animal audio when clicked. 


Feature 6 - index.html > MoMo game > wrong game button: displays a panel with the text
"WRONG", a restart button underneath and plays a Tarzan sound when wrong animal panel is clicked.
When the panel is clicked it restarts the game and current score count. 


Feature 7 - index.html > MoMo game > winner game button: displays a panel with a fontawesome
icon nof a trophy, the text "WINNER", a restart button and plays a Tarzan sound
when wrong animal panel is clicked. When the panel is clicked it restarts the game and
current score count. 


Feature 8 - index.html > Audio button: allows users to turn off and on the
audio. First when the webpage is loaded the button shows that sound is enabled with a fontawesome
icon picturing a megaphone with soundwaves on the right side, it also has a decreased opacity
effect when hovered. When clicked the audio is disabled throughout the webpage and the fontawesome icon
changes to a megaphone with a cross over it. When clicked again the fontawesome icon changes
back to the original and enables audio again.


Feature 9 - index.html > Restart buttons: allows users to restart the game at any time. It also
has a decreased opacity effect when hovered. When pressed it restarts the game and resets the current
score to 0. If the start, wrong or winner panels are covering the animal panels they will disappear
when the restart button is clicked.
hovered


Feature 10 - index.html > Highscore: allows users to see their own score, both
current and highest. The highest score is locally stored so when the webpage is closed
and reopened the highest score is still visible.


Feature 11 - index.html > Theme buttons: three separate buttons allows users to interact with the
interface design of the webpage by switching between three diffrent colored themes. The current or
recently pressed theme is locally stored so when the webpage is refreshed or closed and reopened the
recent theme will be loaded.



### Features Left to Implement
An idea of more features to implement would be to make themes for the animal panels and there for switch
the images of animals and change them to something else. Either cars, plants, other animals or popular 
characters like pokÃ©mons, marvel characters or the powerpuff girls. Also change the audio to match the
choosen theme.

### Code Testing
- Jasmine testing

### Bugs:
Recived:
"NotAllowedError: The play method is not allowed by the user agent or the platform in the current context, possibly because the user denied permission."
When the site automatically played up the game flash sequence. To fix the problem I added a call to the automatic starting function of sequence to first
be played after one ofe the animal buttons have been clicked. After this was implemented there was no longer a error message.

- Wrong color of logo
When I uploaded the dark MoMo logo the background color was #25161b when swatched before I uploaded it to the page and
afterwards it became slightly lighter, making it visibly stand out from the background color that had the swatched hex color.
To get the later hex color of the logo I needed to do a printscreen of the webpage with the logo uploaded and swatch the color
to recive #2a1c21 and then use that color as my default dark themed hex color.

- NaN in Highest highscore (Had to clear cache)
